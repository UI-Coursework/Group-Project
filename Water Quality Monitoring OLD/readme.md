### Overview
- This application is designed to monitor and analyse water quality data, with a focus on pollutant tracking and compliance with safety standards. 
- It was developed using **C++/Qt6** with a modular and user-friendly interface that adapts to changes in locale for basic internationalisation.

### Main Components

## Key Features
- **Internationalization**: Automatically adjusts the application language based on system locale settings.
- **Modular UI**: Logical grouping of controls and data in a sleek card layout.

## Design Choices

## Known Issues
- Slight delay when transitioning between pages.
- Map feature is currently in development and uses static placeholder data.

## Future Development
- Integrate dynamic geospatial maps with interactive markers.
- Add support for advanced statistical analysis.
- Implement user authentication for multi-user access control.
